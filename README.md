# YellowStone National Park Simulation

A Yellowstone National Park Simulation project that uses boids algorithm to represent the behavior of wolves and deers, and includes a computational model of vegetation affected by wolves/deers interaction.

## Overview

This project aims to simulate the dynamics of a park environment using a combination of boids algorithm and computational models. It represents the behavior of wolves and deers, and also includes a model of vegetation that is affected by the interaction between these animals.

## Features

- Boids Algorithm: The behavior of wolves and deers is simulated using the boids algorithm, which takes into account factors like separation, alignment, and cohesion to create realistic movement patterns.
- Vegetation Model: The vegetation in the park is represented using computational models. It grows over time, interacts with the animals, and regenerates in areas that have been depleted.
- Interactive Simulation: The simulation allows users to observe and interact with the park environment. They can see the movement of animals, the growth of vegetation, and the impact of animal-vegetation interaction.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NameerAli/YellowStone-National-Park-Simulation.git
   ```

2. Open the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd yellowstone
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

- Upon running the simulation, you will see the canvas representing the park environment.
- The deers and wolves will be represented by different entities moving around the canvas according to the boids algorithm.
- The vegetation will grow over time and interact with the animals.
- You can observe the dynamics of the park environment and how the animals and vegetation interact with each other.
