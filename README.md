# YellowStone National Park Simulation
   
    Initialization: We start by creating objects or data structures to represent the vegetation in our park. Each object will have properties like position, size, growth rate, and current size. We can create multiple objects to represent different plants or areas of vegetation.

    Update Function: We have a special function called regularly, like every frame or at a fixed interval. This function is responsible for updating the state of the vegetation over time.

    Growth: Inside the update function, we increase the size of the vegetation objects based on their growth rate. We calculate the new size by adding a small increment to the current size. This makes the plants gradually grow over time.

    Interaction with Animals: We also consider the interaction between vegetation and animals like deer. When a deer interacts with the vegetation, such as by eating it, we can modify the properties of the vegetation objects accordingly. For example, we can reduce the size of the plants that have been eaten by subtracting a certain amount from their current size.

    Regeneration: To simulate the regeneration of vegetation, we can introduce a mechanism to create new vegetation objects over time. For example, if a deer has fully consumed a plant, we can create a new vegetation object in its place with a small initial size. This gives the appearance of new plants growing in areas that have been depleted.

By continuously updating the vegetation objects based on their growth rate, interacting with animals, and regenerating the vegetation, we create a dynamic and evolving representation of greenery in our park.
